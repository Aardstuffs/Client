Aardwolf Client
======

A client specifically designed for Aardwolf!

Will include:
- A graphical representation of the game
- Aardwolf-specific tools (alerts for quests and campaigns, a mapper to make travelling easier, etc.)
- Easy access to the console from the graphical version of the game (and it won't take up half the screen, at least by default)

If you want to help:
- If you have any good ideas for the name of the client, post a note to either TehPers or Marikk on board personal with it
- Ask Marikk in-game for ways to help find textures
- We will have an easy-to-use system for designing the rooms. Once that's completed, you're welcome to make rooms
- When testing versions are released, you are welcome to try it out and post issues if you have any problems.
- If you want to help with the code, fork this repository, make changes, and make a pull request.

** NOTE ** If you want to help with any of the above, we greatly appreciate it. However, until the base for the client is done, we cannot accept anything but pull requests.
